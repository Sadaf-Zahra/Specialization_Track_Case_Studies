# Statistical & Predictive Modeling Case Studies
## Overview

This repository contains a collection of case studies and projects focused on statistical methods, inferential analysis, estimation theory, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling.  
Each notebook demonstrates the application of Python-based statistical techniques to real-world problems.

## Repository Contents

Covers building and evaluating predictive models using machine learning techniques.

* Case_Study_Logistic_Regression.ipynb

Explores binary classification problems using logistic regression.

* Case_Study_Inferential_Statistics.ipynb

Demonstrates sampling, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

* Case_Study_Estimation_Theory.ipynb

Focuses on estimation methods (point & interval estimates).

* Case_Study_Common_Statistical_Tests1.ipynb

Covers tests such as t-test, chi-square, and ANOVA.

* Case_Study_Common_Statistical_Test2.ipynb

Includes additional hypothesis tests and their applications.

## What I Did
